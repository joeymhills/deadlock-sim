GENERAL TODOS:

***********************
*** START USING ZOD ***
***********************

-As complexity grows, I might need to introduce a "scheduler" that schedules events instead of leaving the events to schedule themselves;

SIM NOTES:
-Add channel time
-autocast option

-use steam api/0auth
-add abilities + ability points
-add items
-add health regen to sim:

NOTES ON ITEM ITERACTIONS:
General:
- Headshot multiplier is 2x;

Vitality:
- Percentage health increases only affect BASE health;
- All additive health increases are just "Bonus Health";
Weapon:
- Always percentage based(just add percentages and apply at the end);
Spirit:
- Always additive;

NITPICKY UI SHIT:
- Remove state for hovering(i.e. replace with hover:bg-opacity-50)
- add loaders before fonts load to prevent ui shift
- add loaders and animations for everything else
